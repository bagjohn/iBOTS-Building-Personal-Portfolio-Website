## About

<img src="/images/photo.formal.jpg" alt="Photo of Panagiotis Sakagiannis" style="float: right; max-width: 180px; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; border-radius: 4px;">

I have studied Medicine and Mathematics and completed my residency in Clinical Neurology, working across multiple university hospitals in Greece. After an MSc in Neuroscience I shifted toward computational approaches and recently completed a PhD in behavioral modeling at the University of Cologne, developing a mechanistic, whole-organism framework for linking neural, behavioral, and metabolic processes.

My interests lie at the intersection of computational neuroscience, behavior-based modeling, and biological control architectures, especially in understanding how structured behavior emerges from neural and homeostatic dynamics. I enjoy working with agent-based models, hierarchical control systems, and mechanistic simulations, and I developed Larvaworld—a simulation platform for integrative behavioral modeling—as part of my doctoral research.

At the same time, I aim to maintain a connection to my clinical background. I am particularly interested in roles that bridge computational methods with clinical neurology, whether through behavioral data analysis, modeling of neural or cognitive processes, or computational approaches to understanding patient behavior, decision-making, or disease mechanisms.

## Doctorate thesis

My doctoral work at the University of Cologne focused on building a mechanistic, integrative framework for Drosophila larva behaviour, combining neural circuit models, behavioural control architectures, and metabolic constraints. The thesis builds on the Larvaworld platform and related publications listed below.
